# Shared Workshop Authoring Guidelines

Use these rules across workshop authoring/editing workflows to keep the tutorial beginner-friendly and centered on one consistent Codespaces journey.

## Workshop delivery assumptions

These guidelines assume the standard delivery context for GitHub- and Microsoft-organized workshops: learners arrive through the **golden-ticket provisioning system**, which creates a temporary workshop org and handles all billing. Write all core workshop content against these baseline assumptions:

- **Codespace is already open.** Learners start from a pre-launched Codespace inside their provisioned practice repository. Do not add environment-creation steps (local Git setup, SSH key generation, manual Codespace creation) to the core route.
- **Copilot CLI is the primary AI surface.** Use `gh copilot` (Copilot CLI in the Codespace terminal) as the default agent surface for every AI-assisted task in the core workshop. Side quests may cover Copilot Chat, IDE extensions, or other surfaces as alternatives.
- **Org and billing are pre-provisioned.** The golden-ticket system creates the workshop org, assigns Copilot seats, and covers billing for the duration. Do not include billing setup, Copilot seat assignment, org creation, or payment steps in any core workshop content.
- **Practice repository is pre-created.** Each learner's practice repository exists before they begin. Learners never fork, clone, or create it manually during a golden-ticket workshop session.

## Codespaces-first tooling progression

- Use Codespaces as the sole recommended environment in the core workshop.
- Do not require `gh` installation/authentication in early shared steps unless a command in that same step truly requires it.
- Delay `gh` setup and `gh-aw` install requirements until the latest practical point (typically the dedicated install step or later).
- Keep `gh` command volume focused, then run required CLI commands in the Codespace terminal.
- Put local-terminal and browser-only alternatives in clearly labeled side quests instead of branching the core journey.

## Codespaces-first instruction design

- Keep the core route in Codespaces, even when an individual action opens the repository, settings, or Actions page on GitHub.com.
- Do not describe a GitHub.com action as a separate browser-only student route.
- Keep required terminal instructions concise and explicit.
- For workflow dispatch, always teach GitHub Actions UI dispatch first; mention CLI dispatch only as an advanced option.

## Prerequisite discipline

- List only prerequisites needed immediately for the current step.
- Avoid future-looking prerequisites that front-load setup before learners need it.
- Never require `gh auth login` in a step that does not use authenticated `gh` commands.

## Learner empathy

- Assume many learners are new to terminal workflows.
- Keep command-heavy content narrow, purposeful, and optional when possible.
- When terminal use is unavoidable, point learners to Codespaces as a low-friction bridge.

## AI agent guidance

- Prefer the **AI agent that runs your agentic workflows** (such as Copilot, Claude, or Codex) as the recommended prompt surface for all agentic workflow tasks. In the core workshop, "Copilot" always means **Copilot CLI (`gh copilot`) in the terminal already open in the learner's Codespace**, not a GitHub.com prompt surface and not an IDE extension. Using the same agent locally during authoring and testing gives learners behavior that matches production — unlike Copilot Chat (Agent Mode) in an IDE, which runs in a different harness and may behave differently. Side quests may introduce alternative surfaces, but never the core route.
- When a learner is using their AI agent, tell them what prompt to pass; do **not** present shell commands as though they run inside the agent chat.
- If a learner needs to start Copilot from the terminal, explicitly separate the launch command (for example `gh copilot`) from the prompt they should paste next.
- Use `prompt` as the fenced code block language for prompts passed to an AI agent so the rendered workshop clearly distinguishes agent input from terminal commands and other code.
- When the task is to create, edit, debug, or upgrade an agentic workflow, always route learners through their AI agent with the `/agentic-workflows` skill.
- Do **not** recommend manual workflow editing as the primary instruction path; use the AI agent + `/agentic-workflows` prompts instead.
- If a step still requires separate terminal work (for example `gh aw init` or `gh aw compile`), clearly separate the terminal action from the agent prompt so learners know which surface to use for each action.
- Keep every prompt shown in a workshop page **simple: a single clear sentence** that a human would write in one shot. Avoid multi-part instructions, bullet-formatted prompts, or over-engineered phrasing inside the prompt block itself. If the task is complex, let the `/agentic-workflows` skill handle decomposition — the learner's input stays short and natural.

## Golden-Ticket Workshop Surfaces

- The golden-ticket workshop is the fully preconfigured beginner path: Copilot, repository setup, and Codespaces bootstrapping are prepared ahead of time.
- **Org provisioning and billing are handled by the golden-ticket system.** For GitHub- and Microsoft-organized workshops, the provisioning tooling creates a temporary workshop org, assigns Copilot seats to all participants, and covers billing for the duration. Do not add billing setup, payment method configuration, Copilot seat assignment, or org creation instructions to any core workshop step — those are prerequisites the golden-ticket system satisfies before learners open the first page.
- Some workshop content is intentionally reused in golden-ticket workshop surfaces such as an org profile README and a learner-repository Codespaces launcher.
- The maintained golden-ticket workshop assets live on the `golden-ticket-workshop` branch under `.github/participant-template/` plus `.github/workflows/create-participants-repo.yml`. During org provisioning, that branch is copied into the provisioned org's `.github-private` repository.
- When you change workshop onboarding language that should also appear in those golden-ticket surfaces, update the marked source blocks in `workshop/00-welcome.md` and have the responsible agent check whether the `golden-ticket-workshop` branch also needs a corresponding update.
- When an agent edits onboarding, setup, Codespaces, or early navigation content on `main`, it should explicitly assess downstream impact on `golden-ticket-workshop` and either update the affected branch assets or state why no branch change is needed.
- Treat `workshop/00-welcome.md` as the source only for intentionally shared workshop framing and onboarding copy, not for page structure.
- Treat the golden-ticket participant `README.md` as a separate launcher artifact for the preconfigured beginner experience, not as a structural mirror of `workshop/00-welcome.md`.
- Keep the ending call-to-action intentionally different: `workshop/00-welcome.md` should continue learners into the next workshop step, while the golden-ticket participant `README.md` should direct them into the precreated repository and Codespaces flow.
- The participant template's `README.md`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`, and the provisioning workflow are standalone assets and must be reviewed and tested in the branch and `.github-private` context where they run.
- For golden-ticket learner repositories, prefer a Codespaces launcher entry point that starts at Step 4 or Step 5 because org invite, repository creation, and Codespace creation are already complete.

## Positioning agentic workflows as an Actions-compatible superset

- Present agentic workflows as a **smooth transition from classic GitHub Actions**, not a replacement that forces learners to start over.
- State explicitly that frontmatter is **Actions YAML compatible** (triggers, permissions, runners, and deterministic steps still apply), while the Markdown body is the agent prompt with advanced templating features.
- Reinforce that workflow authors can create **hybrid deterministic + agentic designs** by keeping or importing custom jobs and steps for fixed data collection, then delegating reasoning and synthesis to the agent.
- In data-ops examples, teach a split of responsibilities: deterministic steps fetch/shape data, and the agentic prompt interprets that data and decides how to communicate outcomes.

## gh-aw is a compile-time tool, not a runtime component

`gh-aw` is a developer CLI that compiles `.md` workflow files into standard GitHub Actions YAML (`.lock.yml`). It runs at **author time**, not inside GitHub Actions:

- The developer runs `gh aw compile` locally (or in a Codespace) to produce the `.lock.yml`.
- The `.lock.yml` is committed to the repository like any other workflow file.
- When a trigger fires, **GitHub Actions executes the `.lock.yml` directly** — `gh-aw` is not installed on or invoked by the runner.

Do not describe `gh-aw` as a runtime bridge, middleware, or orchestrator that runs inside the workflow job. Correct: "gh-aw compiles your `.md` into a `.lock.yml`." Incorrect: "gh-aw runs inside GitHub Actions and calls the AI model."

When creating or updating architecture diagrams for the workshop:

- Show `gh aw compile` in a clearly labeled **compile-time** zone, separate from the GitHub Actions workflow run.
- Show GitHub Actions executing the `.lock.yml` (not invoking `gh-aw`) in the runtime zone.
- The runtime flow is: Trigger → GitHub Actions (executes `.lock.yml`) → AI Model → Output.

## Header style

- Do **not** number Markdown headers inside a file. Use descriptive headings such as `### Open the Codespace`, not `### 2. Open the Codespace`.
- Keep ordering in ordered lists, tables, filenames, and checkpoint lists instead of in the heading text itself.

## Theme-aware workshop images

When Playwright or another automation creates a workshop screenshot or diagram,
generate both light and dark variants during the same run. Name them
`<stem>-light.<ext>` and `<stem>-dark.<ext>`, then use GitHub's
[theme-aware `<picture>` pattern](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-make-your-images-in-markdown-on-github-adjust-for-dark-mode-and-light-mode/#one-snippet-two-themes):

```html
<picture>
    <source
        media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
        srcset="images/<stem>-dark.svg"
    />
    <source
        media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"
        srcset="images/<stem>-light.svg"
    />
    <img alt="Concise descriptive alt text" src="images/<stem>-light.svg" />
</picture>
```

- Keep the fallback `<img>` and use the light variant as its `src`.
- Put alt text on the fallback `<img>`; do not duplicate it on `<source>` elements.
- Capture or render each variant with Playwright's matching `colorScheme` setting.
- If an image includes text, size that text to match normal rendered documentation body text so it remains legible after Markdown scaling.
- Verify in both color schemes that `currentSrc` selects the expected variant and
  that the image is nonblank, readable, and free of clipping or overflow.

Existing single-theme workshop images are migration candidates, not exceptions:

- Inventory Markdown image references and HTML `src`/`srcset` references so
  existing `<picture>` blocks remain auditable.
- Migrate at most three existing visuals per automated pull request. Process core
  workshop pages before setup paths, advanced topics, and side quests.
- Preserve each visual's stem and alt text while creating `-light` and `-dark`
  variants and replacing the original reference with the `<picture>` pattern.
- Create a genuine theme-specific variant for UI screenshots and diagrams. A
  theme-neutral photo may use the same existing file for both `<source>` entries
  instead of duplicating the binary.
- Do not delete an original asset until no Markdown or HTML reference uses it.

## GitHub visual language system

When a generated diagram or illustration depicts a GitHub concept — such as an issue, pull request, discussion, commit, repository, or workflow run — use the GitHub visual language to represent it. This keeps diagrams recognisable to learners who already know the GitHub UI and avoids generic icon fonts or ambiguous shapes.

### Licensed Octicons

Use unmodified path geometry from the MIT-licensed
[Primer Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons) set. Embed the path directly
in the SVG so diagrams remain self-contained, and preserve the applicable
license attribution. Do not trace, simplify, redraw, or approximate Octicons.

| Concept                | Primer Octicon           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Issue (open)           | `issue-opened`           |
| Issue (closed)         | `issue-closed`           |
| Pull request (open)    | `git-pull-request`       |
| Pull request (merged)  | `git-merge`              |
| Pull request (draft)   | `git-pull-request-draft` |
| Discussion             | `comment-discussion`     |
| Commit                 | `git-commit`             |
| Repository             | `repo`                   |
| Workflow / Actions run | `workflow` or `play`     |
| Schedule trigger       | `clock`                  |

Use the official 16 × 16 or 24 × 24 viewBox and scale it uniformly to fit the
diagram's label box.

### Primer semantic colors for entity states

Apply state-specific colors consistently so learners can interpret diagram nodes at a glance.

| State          | Light mode | Dark mode | Applies to                              |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Open           | `#1a7f37`  | `#3fb950` | Open issues, open PRs                   |
| Closed         | `#cf222e`  | `#f85149` | Closed issues, closed PRs               |
| Merged         | `#8250df`  | `#a371f7` | Merged pull requests                    |
| Draft          | `#57606a`  | `#8b949e` | Draft PRs, pending items                |
| In progress    | `#9a6700`  | `#e3b341` | Running workflow steps, in-flight items |
| Done / Success | `#1a7f37`  | `#3fb950` | Completed steps, passing checks         |
| Skipped        | `#57606a`  | `#8b949e` | Skipped steps, inactive paths           |
| Danger / Error | `#cf222e`  | `#f85149` | Failed checks, error states             |

When the diagram is theme-aware, apply the matching column's values to each SVG variant.

### GitHub visual language usage rules

- **Always use GitHub icons** when a node represents a GitHub entity (issue, PR, discussion, commit, repository). Do not substitute plain rectangles or generic bullet shapes for recognisable GitHub concepts.
- **Accompany every icon node with a text label.** The icon conveys type; the label conveys content. Together they must be readable without prior knowledge of the icon.
- **Match state to color.** An open-issue node must use the open/green semantic color; a merged-PR node must use the merged/purple color. Do not use accent blue for concept nodes that have an explicit state color.
- **Declare semantic states.** Add `data-state` to state-bearing shapes. Prefer `open`, `closed`, `merged`, `draft`, `in-progress`, `done`, `success`, `skipped`, `danger`, or `error`.
- **Keep official icon geometry intact.** Scale Octicons uniformly; do not remove details or alter their proportions.
- **Use accent blue (`#0969da` / `#2f81f7`) for non-GitHub-entity highlights** such as data flows, trigger arrows, or focus callouts that do not correspond to a GitHub object.
- **Do not mix icon vocabularies.** Never combine Octicons with Material Design, Font Awesome, or other third-party icon conventions in the same diagram.

### Enforcing the visual language spec

Run the static SVG visual language checker locally before committing new or updated SVG files:

```bash
node scripts/check-svg-visual-language.js
```

To check specific files only:

```bash
SVG_FILES="workshop/images/foo-light.svg workshop/images/foo-dark.svg" \
  node scripts/check-svg-visual-language.js
```

The rendered contrast check applies the brand skill's WCAG text thresholds to
SVGs that declare `data-visual-kind`. Unannotated legacy SVGs retain the
previous `3:1` text baseline until they are migrated. New or regenerated
complex visuals must declare the metadata, so normal text is checked at
`4.5:1` and qualifying large or bold text at `3:1`.

The check runs automatically in CI via `.github/workflows/svg-visual-language-check.yml` whenever SVG files change. Pull requests that introduce violations in changed SVG files will fail the check. Push events that introduce violations on `main` will create or update a tracked issue.

## Alert callouts: use `<details>` only for multi-line content

### Alert level ceiling

Use the **lowest alert level that accurately conveys the information**. For regular workshop content, cap callout severity at `[!NOTE]` or `[!TIP]`. Do **not** escalate to `[!WARNING]` or `[!CAUTION]` unless the situation is a **major security issue** — for example, a step that could expose credentials or grant unintended broad permissions.

- Prefer `[!TIP]` for helpful hints and shortcuts.
- Prefer `[!NOTE]` for important-but-not-urgent context that a learner should read.
- Use `[!IMPORTANT]` sparingly for information the learner **must** act on before continuing safely.
- Reserve `[!WARNING]` and `[!CAUTION]` for **major security issues only** (e.g., credential exposure, irreversible destructive actions with significant consequences). Do not use them for ordinary setup caveats, optional tool differences, or anything that would merely inconvenience a learner.
- Never use dramatic or alarmist language in callout body text. Keep the tone calm and matter-of-fact even when the level is high.

GitHub alert callouts (`> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`) follow two patterns depending on how much content the callout contains.

**Single-line callout:** place the text directly in the blockquote — no `<details>` wrapper.

**Multi-line callout:** wrap the content in a `<details>` element so the page stays scannable by default and reveals supplementary information only when the learner expands it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never put all content inside a `<summary>` with an empty `<details>` body. That creates a broken disclosure widget — the learner can click the expand triangle but nothing more appears.

### Pattern — single-line

```markdown
> [!TYPE]
> Single informative sentence that stands on its own.
```

### Pattern — multi-line

```markdown
> [!TYPE]
>
> <details>
> <summary>One-line summary visible when collapsed</summary>
>
> Full content revealed when expanded. Can include lists,
> tables, code blocks, and other Markdown.
>
> </details>
```

- The `<summary>` line is always visible. Make it informative enough to stand alone — a learner should be able to decide whether to expand without reading the body.
- If the callout has a **bold title** on the first line (e.g. `**Enterprise users: complete this check before continuing.**`), use that title as the `<summary>` and place the remainder of the content in the body.
- Markdown bold syntax (`**...**`) is not supported inside `<summary>`; use HTML bold (`<b>...</b>`) instead.
- Keep the `>` blockquote prefix on every line including blank separator lines (use `>` on its own for blank lines inside the adornment).
- Do **not** use `<details open>` — the collapsed default enforces progressive disclosure.

### Examples

Single-line callout (plain text, no `<details>`):

```markdown
> [!TIP]
> **Already know GitHub Actions?** Check the three boxes below and skip ahead.
```

Multi-line callout (summary + body):

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details>
> <summary><b>Enterprise users: complete this check before continuing.</b></summary>
>
> - [ ] Copilot Enterprise is enabled for the organization
> - [ ] A Copilot Enterprise seat is assigned to your account
>
> </details>
```

## Step ordering: environment before tools, credentials before running

- Do not instruct learners to install `gh` or `gh-aw` before the recommended Codespace is open. Local installation belongs in a side quest and must still come after local environment setup.
- Always guide learners to trigger manual workflow runs from the GitHub Actions web UI.
- If a step includes `gh aw run`, present it as an optional advanced path only and place credential setup (`gh auth login`) before the CLI-trigger instructions. Learners can verify their Copilot access is included in their authentication by running `gh auth status` and confirming the `github.com` token includes the `read:org` scope or that a Copilot subscription is active under their account (covered in [Install the gh-aw CLI Extension](../../workshop/06-install-gh-aw.md)).

## Schedule triggers: always use fuzzy syntax in agentic workflow files

- In agentic workflow `.md` files, **always** use fuzzy schedule expressions such as `schedule: daily`, `schedule: daily on weekdays`, `schedule: weekly`, or `schedule: every 6 hours`.
- **Never** write raw cron syntax (e.g., `- cron: "0 8 * * *"`) inside an agentic workflow `.md` file. Cron expressions belong only in the compiled `.lock.yml` files generated by `gh aw compile`.
- Classic GitHub Actions YAML workflows use cron syntax directly. Agentic workflows do not — `gh aw compile` generates the cron value automatically.

## Node.js is not required

- Do **not** list Node.js as a prerequisite or required tool anywhere in the workshop.
- Do **not** include `node --version` checks or Node.js install steps in any activity or setup step.
- Node.js is incidentally present in Codespaces but learners must never be told they need to install or verify it.
- If a step currently references Node.js, remove that reference and update any associated checkpoint items.

## Core route and environment side quests

- Keep one uninterrupted Codespaces route through the core curriculum; do not add environment choice hubs.
- Put local-terminal or browser-only alternatives in `side-quest-NN-MM-<slug>.md` files and label them optional.
- Give each environment side quest a clear return point to the core workshop.
- Keep shared terminal steps environment-neutral when local side-quest learners rejoin them.
- Treat GitHub.com pages as action surfaces within the Codespaces journey, not as separate student paths.
- Guide learners to compile after each meaningful workflow change with `gh aw compile`. Recommend `gh aw compile --watch` as an optional continuous-feedback mode.

### Compile defaults

- Prefer `gh aw compile` as the default command in workshop instructions; learners do not need to specify a filename in most cases.
- Reserve `--validate` for targeted troubleshooting or explicit schema/deprecation audits.

### Compile checkpoints

- In the core Codespaces route, place a compile checkpoint after each meaningful addition to the workflow file.
- A browser-only side quest may delegate compilation to an agent, but must say who compiles and commits the lock file.

## Git staging: always use `git add .`

- In all workshop terminal examples, use `git add .` to stage changes — never list individual filenames or paths (e.g., do **not** write `git add .github/workflows/foo.md .github/workflows/foo.lock.yml`).
- Using `git add .` keeps snippets short, avoids filename drift when workflows are renamed, and mirrors how most learners naturally stage their work.

## Code blocks: always specify `bash` for shell commands

- Use ` ```bash ` as the language identifier for every fenced code block containing shell or terminal commands.
- Do **not** leave shell command blocks unlabeled; bare ` ``` ` fences without a language specifier are reserved for content that has no matching language identifier (for example, pseudocode or AI task brief excerpts).
- Use ` ```text ` for terminal output that learners read but do not type (for example, expected command output or error messages).
- Use ` ```yaml ` for standalone YAML configuration fragments, ` ```markdown ` for Markdown syntax examples, and ` ```html ` or ` ```xml ` for markup.
- When showing an agentic workflow example that includes both frontmatter and prompt body, prefer a ` ```markdown ` block that shows the full Markdown+frontmatter file shape instead of isolating the frontmatter in a standalone ` ```yaml ` region.
- When a fenced snippet represents the contents of a file, add the filename after the language token so the rendered snippet chrome can surface it (for example, ` ```markdown .github/workflows/daily-status.md ` or ` ```yaml .github/workflows/daily-status.lock.yml `).
- Prefer the bare relative path form for filename metadata in workshop content. The renderer also supports keyed metadata such as `title=` or `file=`, but workshop pages should use the bare path consistently unless a page needs a more complex title.
- Match the filename extension to the snippet language (`.md` for `markdown`, `.yml`/`.yaml` for `yaml`, and so on), and keep the same filename across a page while the learner is still editing that same file.

## Enterprise user preference in design decisions

When two workshop design choices are of equal or comparable value, **favor the option that better serves enterprise users** — learners using GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES), GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC), or self-hosted runners. Apply this rule at every decision point:

- **Path prioritization**: when two candidate nodes or improvements are comparable in scope and impact, choose the one that closes a gap for enterprise learners first.
- **Default examples**: when selecting a code example, URL, or configuration snippet and multiple options are valid, prefer one that works in both github.com and enterprise environments (for example, avoid hardcoded `github.com` URLs where an enterprise base URL would be needed).
- **Credential and network guidance**: when documenting authentication, token, or network steps, include enterprise-specific notes (SSO, SAML, proxy configuration) alongside the standard path — even when they are not the primary path.
- **Tie-breaking for individual actions**: when both GitHub.com and Codespace terminal instructions work within the core route, prefer the approach that is reliable in enterprise environments.
- **Side-quest and branch selection**: when choosing which optional content to add next, enterprise-relevant topics (self-hosted runners, GHES configuration, enterprise authentication) take precedence over non-enterprise topics of equal priority.

This rule does not override clearly superior choices for all learners. It is a tie-breaker, not an absolute reorder of priorities.

## No "See Also" sections or "For more details" footers — documentation links belong inline

- Do **not** add `## See Also`, `## :books: See Also`, or any equivalent dedicated "See Also" section to workshop files.
- Do **not** add a `For more details, see …` sentence at the end of a step or section. These trailing footers add noise without improving comprehension.
- When a concept or term has a matching reference page in the gh-aw docs, link it **inline** at its first bare occurrence in the prose (e.g., `[safe-outputs](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/)`).
- If you want to surface a relevant doc URL without anchoring it to specific prose, place the bare URL on its own line in the text — do **not** wrap it in a `[title](url)` list under a "See Also" heading.
- Any existing `## See Also` / `## :books: See Also` sections and any `For more details, see …` lines are violations of this rule and must be removed.

## GitHub emoji shortcodes for icons and visual elements

The workshop docs are rendered with GFM emoji support: `:emoji_name:` shortcodes are converted to `<g-emoji>` elements styled by Primer CSS. Use GitHub emoji shortcodes instead of raw Unicode emoji characters or custom icon fonts so the rendered docs stay on-brand and consistent with GitHub's own design language.

- **Prefer** `:white_check_mark:`, `:rocket:`, `:bulb:`, `:warning:`, and other GitHub-supported shortcodes when you need an icon or decorative symbol in prose, checkpoint headings, or callout text.
- **Do not** paste raw Unicode emoji characters directly into Markdown prose — use the `:shortcode:` form so the build renders a properly sized and styled `<g-emoji>` element.
- **Exception — fenced code blocks:** Markdown emoji shortcodes are **not** processed inside fenced code blocks, so they appear as raw text (e.g. `:thinking:` instead of `:thinking:` rendered as an emoji). When an emoji is part of a code block that simulates agent log output, a correct/wrong marker, or any other display content, use the native Unicode character at render time rather than the shortcode so the rendered output matches the visual intent. The `emoji:` field in agentic workflow YAML frontmatter is an exception — keep those values as `:shortcode:` strings because they are literal `gh-aw` syntax.
- Verify the shortcode exists in the [GitHub emoji list](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet) before using it; unknown shortcodes are passed through as literal text.
- Write checkpoint headings as `## :white_check_mark: Checkpoint` so they use the same browser-independent rendering as other icons.

## Consistency check

Before finalizing workshop edits, quickly confirm that:

- The core route remains Codespaces-only; environment alternatives remain side quests.
- Early steps do not require `gh` before it is truly needed.
- Node.js is not listed as a prerequisite.
- All AI-assisted tasks in the core route use Copilot CLI (`gh copilot`) — not Copilot Chat on GitHub.com or IDE extensions.
- No core step contains billing setup, payment method configuration, Copilot seat assignment, or org creation instructions (those are handled by the golden-ticket provisioning system).
- The responsible agent has checked whether any onboarding or setup changes also require updates on the `golden-ticket-workshop` branch.

## Activity numbering for a sortable adventure graph

Use a single activity ID scheme across core steps, branch variants, and side quests so tables of contents can be regenerated by script.

- **Core/shared step IDs**: `NN` (two digits, zero-padded), for example `00`, `01`, `10`.
- **Choose-your-path branch IDs**: `NNx` where `x` is a lowercase branch letter, for example `02a`, `02b`.
- **Side-quest IDs**: `NN-SQMM` where:
    - `NN` is the parent/main step number where learners branch out
    - `MM` is a two-digit side-quest sequence under that parent (`01`, `02`, ...)
    - Example IDs: `11-SQ01`, `11-SQ02`, `16-SQ01`

Recommended filename patterns for new content:

- Core/shared: `NN-<slug>.md`
- Branch variant: `NNx-<slug>.md`
- Side quest: `side-quest-NN-MM-<slug>.md`

TOC generation rules (script-friendly):

1. Parse activity IDs from filenames using these regexes:
    - Core/shared: `^(?<step>\d{2})-`
    - Branch variant: `^(?<step>\d{2})(?<branch>[a-z])-`
    - Side quest: `^side-quest-(?<step>\d{2})-(?<sq>\d{2})-`
2. Sort by `(step ASC, type_order ASC, branch/sq ASC)` where `type_order` is:
    - `0` = core/shared step
    - `1` = branch variant
    - `2` = side quest
3. Render labels as:
    - Core/shared: `NN`
    - Branch variant: `NNx`
    - Side quest: `NN-SQMM`

This keeps IDs lexically sortable, preserves the choose-your-adventure branch model, and cleanly groups optional side quests under their parent step.

## Workshop page annotation schema

Every Markdown file in `workshop/` (except `README.md`) starts with two XML comment lines that describe the user journey and adventure category of the page. Tools and tables of contents use these fields to filter pages by learner profile. XML comments are not rendered by GitHub Markdown, so learners never see them.

### Page annotation format

```markdown
<!-- page-journey: <value> -->
<!-- page-adventure: <value> -->
```

These two lines must be the **very first content** in the file, before the `#` heading.

The `page-` prefix distinguishes page-level annotations from section-level `<!-- journey: X -->` / `<!-- /journey -->` region markers used inside the page body.

### `journey` — learner path

Describes which learner profile the page targets.

### Journey comment markers for conditional sections

Use XML comments with a `journey` marker when only part of a page should be shown for a specific learner journey.

```xml
<!-- journey: ui -->
...content shown only for the UI journey...
<!-- /journey -->
```

Rules:

- `journey:` accepts one or more comma-separated journey values from this schema: `all`, `ui`, `terminal`, `codespace`, `local`, `copilot`.
- Use `all` only when a downstream processor requires explicit tagging for every block in a normalized output. If no filtering is needed for a block, prefer leaving it unwrapped instead of `journey: all`.
- Keep the page-level `<!-- page-journey: X -->` annotation on line 1 of the file. Section-level comment markers (`<!-- journey: X -->` / `<!-- /journey -->`) are for filtering content blocks inside a page, not page-level routing.
- Prefer journey comment markers for path-specific alerts/callouts and for `Next` navigation link blocks.
- Wrap complete block sections (for example, a full callout or a full next-step line), not partial words inside a sentence.
- Do not nest journey markers. Keep each commented journey block self-contained, and place it at normal block boundaries (paragraphs, list items, callouts, or next-link lines).

### Forward navigation link format

When a workshop page points the learner to the next workshop Markdown file, use a
standalone `**Next:**` line that matches the docs-builder parser exactly:

```markdown
**Next:** [Title](filename.md)
**Next:** Open [Title](filename.md).
```

Rules:

- Keep exactly one internal workshop `.md` link on the `**Next:**` line.
- A trailing period is optional; use it only when it reads naturally in the surrounding prose.
- Put setup details or extra explanation in a separate paragraph, not on the same line as the `**Next:**` link.
- For branching pages, repeat one `**Next:**` line per option rather than switching to `Continue with` or `Continue to`.
- When the next step depends on learner path, wrap each `**Next:**` line in the appropriate `<!-- journey: ... -->` block.

Example patterns:

```markdown
<!-- journey: codespace -->

> [!TIP]
> Using a Codespace? Continue to [Step 2a](02a-setup-codespace.md).

<!-- /journey -->

<!-- journey: local -->

**Next:** [Set Up Your Local Terminal](side-quest-02-01-local-terminal.md)

<!-- /journey -->
```

| Value       | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all`       | Applicable to every learner regardless of environment       |
| `ui`        | GitHub web UI path only (no terminal required)              |
| `terminal`  | Any terminal user — Codespace or local                      |
| `codespace` | Codespace-specific instructions (subset of `terminal`)      |
| `local`     | Local terminal-specific instructions (subset of `terminal`) |
| `copilot`   | Copilot-specific instructions, usually Copilot CLI users    |

Rules for assigning `journey`:

- Use `all` for shared hub pages and conceptual introductions that every learner reads.
- Use `terminal` for pages where the primary instructions require a shell (Codespace or local). Use `codespace` or `local` only when the content is specific to one of those environments and would not apply to the other.
- Use `ui` for pages written exclusively for learners who stay in the GitHub browser UI.
- Use `copilot` for pages that target a Copilot-specific surface, usually Copilot CLI and only exceptionally the Copilot app, CCA, or another dedicated Copilot environment.

### `adventure` — content category

Describes the role the page plays in the overall workshop structure.

| Value        | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core`       | Required shared path — every learner follows these pages           |
| `setup`      | Environment or tool setup steps (Codespace, local, gh-aw install)  |
| `scenario-a` | Adventure Codespace — Daily Repo Status Report                     |
| `scenario-b` | Adventure Local — Daily Documentation Updater                      |
| `scenario-c` | Adventure C — PR Code Reviewer                                     |
| `scenario-d` | Adventure D — Build with GitHub Copilot (CLI / CCA)                |
| `advanced`   | Optional post-core topics (steps 14 and above)                     |
| `side-quest` | Optional deep-dive supplementary content branching off a main step |

### Assignment rules by file pattern

| Filename pattern             | Typical `journey`          | Typical `adventure`  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `NN-<slug>.md` (core/shared) | `all`                      | `core` or `advanced` |
| `NNa-<slug>-terminal.md`     | `terminal`                 | matches parent step  |
| `NNb-<slug>-ui.md`           | `ui`                       | matches parent step  |
| `NNc-<slug>-copilot.md`      | `copilot`                  | matches parent step  |
| `10a-*`, `11a-*`, `11a2-*`   | `all` or split by sub-path | `scenario-a`         |
| `10b-*`, `11b-*`             | `all` or split by sub-path | `scenario-b`         |
| `10c-*`, `11c-*`             | `all` or split by sub-path | `scenario-c`         |
| `11d-*`                      | `copilot`                  | `scenario-d`         |
| `02a-*`, `06a-*`             | `codespace`                | `setup`              |
| `side-quest-NN-MM-<slug>.md` | varies (see below)         | `side-quest`         |

Side quest `journey` assignment:

- `terminal` — content is exclusively about terminal commands or `gh aw compile` (e.g., `side-quest-07-01-compile-workflow.md`).
- `local` — content is specific to the optional local terminal route (e.g., `side-quest-02-01-local-terminal.md`).
- `codespace` — content addresses a Codespaces-specific error or configuration (e.g., `side-quest-08-01-codespaces-actions-write.md`).
- `ui` — content is only applicable to a browser-only side quest (e.g., `side-quest-06-03c-copilot-github-token-ui-only.md`).
- `copilot` — content is specific to a Copilot-focused environment such as Copilot CLI or Copilot CCA (e.g., `side-quest-06-02-cca-codespace.md`).
- `all` — conceptual, reference, or debugging content relevant regardless of environment (the majority of side quests).

## Checkpoint checklist size limit

Every workshop step ends with a `## :white_check_mark: Checkpoint` section that contains a markdown checklist. Keep that checklist — and every other checklist on the page — concise:

- **Maximum 10 checkboxes per page** (across all checklists on the page combined).
- If a natural checkpoint requires more items, split the step into two shorter steps rather than adding more boxes.
- Prefer outcome-oriented items ("Your workflow runs without errors") over procedural ones ("Click the green button") so each box carries meaningful weight.
- Do not duplicate items that already appear in an earlier step's checkpoint.

### Checkbox interactivity by position

The rendered workshop site treats task-list checkboxes differently depending on where they appear relative to the `## :white_check_mark: Checkpoint` heading:

- **Before the Checkpoint heading** — rendered as static, non-interactive indicators. These are used for in-exercise prompts such as "I've made my decision". They carry no toggle state and do not contribute to the progress bar.
- **After the Checkpoint heading** — rendered as toggleable checkboxes. Learners can click them to mark progress; state is persisted in `localStorage` and shown in the per-page progress bar.

## Dispatcher and choice-hub pages: `<!-- learning:false -->`

Some workshop pages are not substantive learning steps — they are **dispatcher pages** (also called choice hubs) that exist purely to route learners to the right branch or to present a brief navigation decision. Examples: "Create and Verify Your Practice Repository" (step 3, which forks to 3a/3b) and "Choose Your Scenario" (step 10, which routes to scenarios A–E).

### Marking a page as a dispatcher

Add the comment `<!-- learning:false -->` anywhere in the file — conventionally placed immediately after the page annotation lines. The parser also accepts `<!-- learning: false -->` (with a space after the colon), but the canonical form without the space is preferred:

```markdown
<!-- page-journey: all -->
<!-- page-adventure: core -->
<!-- learning:false -->

# Choose Your Scenario
```

### Effect on quality scoring

Dispatcher pages are **not excluded from scoring**; they are scored using a different dimension profile that rewards clarity and simplicity rather than active learning:

| Dimension            | Dispatcher weight | Learning-step weight |
| -------------------- | :---------------: | :------------------: |
| `cognitive_load`     |        2.0        |         1.0          |
| `readability`        |        2.0        |         1.0          |
| `style_compliance`   |        2.0        |         1.0          |
| `active_learning`    |        0.0        |         2.0          |
| `checkpoint_quality` |        0.0        |         1.5          |
| `scaffolding`        |        0.0        |         1.5          |

This means automated tools will flag a dispatcher page for being hard to read or cognitively overloaded, but will not penalize it for lacking exercises or checkpoints.

### What to optimize in dispatcher pages

When writing or reviewing a dispatcher page, focus on:

- **Clarity** — every branch option is immediately obvious; no explanation is needed to understand what each path leads to.
- **Brevity** — the page should contain only the decision point and enough context to make the choice. Remove any instructional prose that belongs in the destination page.
- **Cognitive load** — avoid walls of text, nested lists, or multiple callouts. One short paragraph or a simple list is the target.

### When to use this marker

Apply `<!-- learning:false -->` only to pure routing/navigation pages that contain no hands-on activities, no checkpoints, and no substantive technical instruction. Do not apply it to introductory or conceptual pages that teach background knowledge — those are learning pages even if they contain no hands-on steps.
